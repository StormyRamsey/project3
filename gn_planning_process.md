GOLDIE NAUTS - Project 3
Group Members: Adam, Jeong and Stormy

Planning and User Story

Goldie Nauts is a cosmology application that host information about astronauts and habitable planets.

Initially our teams ERD plan consisted of two models with no association. We decided to create a space exploration application where users can:

•	Navigate to a model’s content by clicking on a dynamic button.
•	When a user navigates to a different page they can also have the option to navigate to the top of a page and back to the homepage with an additional floating navigation.
•	Read about some of NASA’s active astronauts.
•	View and read about habitable planets.

How did we decided on this technology?
Ultimately, we were decided on Jeong’s idea to create an application using NASA’s data. The entire team was very interested in using cosmology data as our projects content.
